multicities_flexdates
=====================

Allows for searching kayak.com with multiple cities AND flexible dates, sort of

The idea is that you enter in your multi-leg travel plans one leg at a time, specifying the start of a date range and the number of additional days you'd like to search for and each permutation is opened in a new tab in your default browser.

Crude. Dirty. Inefficient. Not anywhere near the best way to solve the multi-city/flex-date problem.
But quick. And I needed to buy that ticket like yesterday.
